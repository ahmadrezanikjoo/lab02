# Exercise 08: Factorials

## The task

The factorial of a nonnegative integer n is written n! (pronounced “n factorial”) and is defined as follows:
n! = n · (n - 1) · (n - 2) · … · 1 (for values of n greater than or equal to 1)
and
n! = 1 (for n = 0).
For example, 5! = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1, which is 120


Write a program that reads a nonnegative integer and computes and prints its factorial.
